## Full Circle TMS Interview Sample Project

This is a simple web app backed by a SQLite database. It runs ASP.Net Core with Angular front end.
It does require login, but you can create a new user without verifying email (it does not email out anyways).
Once logged in you'll see two pages of interest: **Fetch Data** and **Todo**.

## Tasks

We would like you to compete 4 small tasks using this project:

1. Bug Fix: on Todo list page, number of incomplete items doesnt show in the left panel when that todo list isnt selected
1. Add a temperature filter to fetch data page to allow users to filter the results by a temperature range
1. If no items show on the fetch data page, show an appropriate message instead of empty page
1. Add the ability to track a date on the to-do items, such as "due date". It should be optional.

This should only take a 1-3 hours, if you find yourself stuck please don't hesitate to reach out. 
We're interested in learning your problem solving approach, not looking for specific solutions.
